# Connect 4 Move Finder (Work in Progress)

Connect 4 is a popular children's game played on a 7x6 game board. 

The rules are simple: 2 Players take turns to drop their coloured pieces into 1 of the 7 columns, and the game ends when 1 player has managed to "Connect 4" pieces vertically, horizontally or diagonally. 

Connect 4 was first solved by James Dow Allen in October 1, 1988, and his strategies were reinforced through brute force when computers got stronger. It is now known that Connect 4 is first-player-win, meaning that with perfect play, the player who goes first will always win. 

This piqued my interest, and thus I set out to make a script using Python that could help me dominate my relatives in Connect 4. 

## Work in Progress
This script is not complete. So far, I have only managed to implement the game rules. From what I've read, I might need to use some form of AI algorithm to make this, but I'll just wing it first without researching too much. 

### 24/12/2021 Update
Win-checking has been implemented. The win-checking code should work regardless of board size, so the win-checking code can be used as long as the board has enough space to accomodate 4 pieces in a row.
